**Summary**

Over the last few years, the study of cultural organizations has kindled the interest of a growing number of researchers who work in diverse fields, disciplines, and perspectives—including cultural and literary history, sociology and international cultural relations. Despite the potential of this object of study, it poses several challenges given the polysemy of the term, the heterogeneous realities encompassed by it and the disciplinary fragmentation from which cultural organizations have been studied to date. In this sense, we lack a shared theoretical framework that would allow us to consider their common features and articulate their differences.

Within this general framework, we understand cultural organizations as: 1) organizations that promote cultural transfer and thus facilitate the circulation of persons, ideas, and symbolic cultural goods, 2) spaces that provide cohesion to national cultural fields by articulating the relationships between the various actors in said space, but which can also enable international projection; and 3) agents that favor the creation of transnational intellectual networks in a broad sense. Certainly, international action in the cultural field can present different connotations according to each culture’s position in the international arena: when it comes to hegemonic cultures, foreign promotion may camouflage an imperialist project, while when it comes to peripheral, non-state, or minority cultures, foreign promotion appears to be a necessary strategy to compensate for a lack of economic and military power. This conference aims at analyzing the strategies deployed by cultural organizations to internationalize a given culture and the entanglements of public and the private actors in such framework. Methodological issues will be also discussed, such as the challenges and possibilities of a transnational comparison or the use of quantitative methods and social network analysis to approach this growing venue of research.
