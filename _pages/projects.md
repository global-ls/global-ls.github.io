## Social Networks of the Past. Mapping Hispanic and Lusophone Literary Modernity, 1898-1959
{: .notice--primary}

This research applies cutting-edge technology to analyse a neglected aspect of European and non-European social and cultural life of the 20th century: the impact of Hispanic and Lusophone literary networks and cultural mediators in international modernity between 1898 and 1959.   
The project pursues three central goals:
   1. to retrieve the lost history of Iberoamerican mediators in modernist intercultural and multilingual networks and reappraise their role;
   1. to narrow the knowledge divide in terms of access and production in the Iberoamerican field by generating and making freely available new and reliable data that addresses the lack of documented cultural heritage, and
   1. to offer an innovative and reproducible model that can be applied across periods, languages, and disciplines to analyse cross-border phenomena, under-examined mediators and networks and overshadowed geographical scales in their relations to the wider world.

These goals will be achieved by a twofold methodology:
   * i) an open and collaborative research tool providing a data source for quantitative and qualitative analysis on Iberoamerican mediators, and
   * ii) four subprojects on key cultural transformation processes distinctive of modern societies  (the institutionalization of Iberoamerican cultures, the rise of translated literature in key Iberoamerican modernist journals, the position of Iberoamerican women in the cultural field, and the role of Iberoamerican mediators in new forms of mass media).

   By combining computational methods, cultural and literary history, translation, sociology, gender and media studies, an interdisciplinary team of 6 researchers  will fill the gap in modernist studies and will significantly contribute, with an empirically tested method, to open new methodological paths for a decentred global cultural history.

## Trad-Data: Translation and Market. The Circulation of Books (Spain-Latin America, 1909-1945) and Big Data
{: .notice--primary}

This project aims to study the circulation of the translated books and their market in the Spanish and Hispanic-American area between 1900 and 1945. The project uses the material evidence of thousands of titles published from and into Spanish, as well as from scattered translations in the most importand cultural and literary magazines of the time to analyze in depth the dynamics of the book market in Spain and Latin America in the first half of the 20th century.

## [MapModern: Mapping Hispanic Modernity. Cross-border Literary Networks and Cultural Mediators (1908-1939)]
{: .notice--primary}

The project sets the grounds for a new approach exploring transnational processes of cultural transformation. To do so, it proposes an innovative investigation in modernist studies: the impact of Hispanic cultural mediators in international modernity during the first half of the twentieth century. Its goal is to amend the fact that literature on aesthetic modernity tends to overlook Hispanic modernism and keeps locating it on the peripheries. However, from the 1900s onwards, Hispanic mediators participated in the cultural arena and took an active part in intercultural and multilingual networks. This project argues that these networks enabled Hispanic mediators to play a prominent role in the international scene, helping them revitalize both Europe and their local milieu. This project understands cultural mediators as agents who meet at least two main parameters: multilingualism, on the one hand, and the performance of numerous activities and roles across linguistic, artistic, and geographical borders on the other.
