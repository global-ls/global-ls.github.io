## Big Translation History: The Use of Data Mining and Big Data Approaches

General description: Data mining and big data approaches are changing the ways in which we create knowledge, access information and preserve our cultural heritage. At the intersection of the Humanities and Computational Technologies, this panel aims to advance in a still new and very innovative research path in translation studies (the study of translation history in a big data age) and explore both theoretical and methodological questions as well as case studies dealing with big translation history. In that respect, the convenors of this panel define big translation history as a translation history that can be analyzed computationally within a big amount of data and propose to address the following approaches and subtopics:

   - **Methodologies for the analysis of translation history at a large scale**: Is it possible to formulate a specific methodology for the study of foreign literatures and translations within a transnational and big data aproach? Can we contribute with new tools and a defined theoretical and methodological framework to the study of big translation history?

   - **Methodological challenges for the collection, analysis and visualization of data and metadata** on and from a significant number of scattered translations in a vast corpus of books or periodicals.

   - **The qualitative and quantitative relationship in the analysis of big translation history**: What possibilities does quantitative analysis open for the study of big translation history and the circulation of literatures and the agents involved in it (translators, publishers, etc.) worldwide? Is it possible to elaborate methods of quantitative analysis of large and heterogeneous corpora so as to overcome the challenges posed by these type of approaches? Is it possible to develop techniques for a qualitative study that put micro-textual analysis (close reading) into play, without neglecting the macrotextual (distant reading)?

   - **Case studies in their relationship with big translation history and the world of publishing or the circulation of translations and the agents involved from different times and geographical spaces.**
