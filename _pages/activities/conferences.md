## Webinar “Between the Nation and the World: the Role of Translation and Para-Diplomatic Initiatives in the Circulation of Small/Minor/Peripheral/Less Translated Literatures”

##### Monday, June 29 2020 from 2:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. and on Tuesday, June 30 2020 from 2:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. [through _Google Meet_].

![European Research Council](/assets/images/logo-eu-erc.png){: .align-right style="width: 10em; height:auto;"} Organized by the *ERC StG project Social Networks of the Past: Mapping Hispanic and Lusophone Literary Modernity (1898-1959)*   (Grant agreement No 803860), led by Diana Roig Sanz.  
IN3- Arts and Humanities Department, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya.

The ERC StG project Social Networks of the Past. Mapping Hispanic and Lusophone Literary Modernity, 1989-1959, part of the Global Literary Studies Research Group (GlobaLS), organizes the webinar **Between the Nation and the World: the Role of Translation and Para-Diplomatic Initiatives in the Circulation of Small/Minor/Peripheral/Less Translated Literatures**. This webinar aims at further defining the notion of the ‘minor’ and related concepts such as the ones above-mentioned within an historical perspective. We advance the hypothesis that minor cultures and literatures are not only relevant in their own right, but also from a broader perspective. In that respect, there is an urgent need to reassess the value of the minor and the role of translation in nation building processes, but also in relation to different scales (regional-national- transnational-international-global). The webinar gathers different case studies which are related to the translation, circulation and institutionalization of small/minor/peripheral and less translated literatures (Czech, Georgian, Yiddish, Catalan, Walloon, native indigenous literatures in Latin America, and Swahili) through processes that may imply intranslation and extranslation and para-diplomatic initiatives in the light of power struggles for legitimization.

Organising Committee: **Ana Kvirikashvili**, **Elisabet Carbó** and **Diana Roig Sanz**.

## [ISIH 2020 Conference: Change and Exchange](http://isih.history.ox.ac.uk/?page_id=6201)

##### <s>27 – 29 May 2020, European University Institute</s> Cancelled due to the Covid-19 crisis.

### With the participation of Neus Rotger

The suddenness of many recent changes has led to a widespread feeling of bewilderment and led many to retreat into what are seen as safe places and idealised pasts, rejection of difference and increasingly violent and intolerant social exchange. At the same time, the evidence of climate change is making people increasingly aware of the need to rethink our way of life. It therefore seems an appropriate moment to look at how change has been understood and conceptualised in the past, how changes in ways of thinking, concepts and paradigms have come about, the strength of resistance to change, and the role of exchange – intellectual and material – in this process. Change and Exchange proposes to explore historical, philosophical, cultural, material, social, environmental and scientific change, the varieties of social, intellectual, material, economic, etc. exchange and the interactions between the two. It will also look at change and exchange in the field of Intellectual History itself.

## Big Translation History: The Use of Data Mining and Big Data Approaches

### [EST Congress Stellenbosch 2019. Living Translation: People, Processes, Products](https://www.est2019.com/)

##### 9-13 September, Stellenbosch, South Africa

Organised by: **Diana Roig-Sanz** (UOC-Open University of Catalonia); **Ondrej Vimr** (University of Bristol); **Laura Fólica** (UOC-Open University of Catalonia).

General description: Data mining and big data approaches are changing the ways in which we create knowledge, access information and preserve our cultural heritage. At the intersection of the Humanities and Computational Technologies, this panel aims to advance in a still new and very innovative research path in translation studies (the study of translation history in a big data age) and explore both theoretical and methodological questions as well as case studies dealing with big translation history. In that respect, the convenors of this panel define big translation history as a translation history that can be analyzed computationally within a big amount of data and propose to address the following approaches and subtopics:

   - **Methodologies for the analysis of translation history at a large scale**: Is it possible to formulate a specific methodology for the study of foreign literatures and translations within a transnational and big data aproach? Can we contribute with new tools and a defined theoretical and methodological framework to the study of big translation history?

   - **Methodological challenges for the collection, analysis and visualization of data and metadata** on and from a significant number of scattered translations in a vast corpus of books or periodicals.

   - **The qualitative and quantitative relationship in the analysis of big translation history**: What possibilities does quantitative analysis open for the study of big translation history and the circulation of literatures and the agents involved in it (translators, publishers, etc.) worldwide? Is it possible to elaborate methods of quantitative analysis of large and heterogeneous corpora so as to overcome the challenges posed by these type of approaches? Is it possible to develop techniques for a qualitative study that put micro-textual analysis (close reading) into play, without neglecting the macrotextual (distant reading)?

   - **Case studies in their relationship with big translation history and the world of publishing or the circulation of translations and the agents involved from different times and geographical spaces.**
