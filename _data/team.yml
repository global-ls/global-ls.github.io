He is currently interested in the cross-cultural collaborations that influenced The Thousand and One Nights, and the reception of the works of 16th Century Portuguese author Luis de Camões, who lived in the Middle East and South Asia. His latest book, _Marvellous Thieves: Secret Authors of the Arabian Nights_ will be published by Harvard University Press in January 2017.


His position in Abu Dhabi, long a cultural crossroads, will provide him a unique opportunity to further his study of both. He joins NYU Abu Dhabi from Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada, where he was an assistant professor. There, he was instrumental in developing the university’s world literature program from the ground up. He is co-editing a volume for the MLA series Approaches to Teaching World Literature and has presented the results of his research on the 1001 Nights and world literature at Harvard, Cornell, Princeton, SOAS, and the Universidad de Sevilla. At Simon Fraser University he was the recipient of a World Literature and Cultural Research Grant and a President’s Research Grant.


At NYU Abu Dhabi, Horta teaches classes on The Thousand and One Nights, the theory and practice of literary translation, and a global history of magic realism, commonly associated with Latin American literature, but also with contemporary Arabic and Persian works. He will bring to the translation course as guest lecturers participants in the Kalima project, an ambitious translation project underway in Abu Dhabi. Horta serves as co-director of a multi-campus research group on world literature, which is hosting a five-year series of interconnected seminars across several continents. He has previously taught classes in political science and literature on globalization, immigration and multiculturalism, and genres and methods in world literature."

   bio         : "Maud Gonne is a FNRS postdoctoral fellow at UNamur and UCLouvain, Belgium. She is currently working on a project that investigates the role of cultural mediators in Wallonia during different stages of (successful and less successful) national and regional identity-building.


   Maud received a PhD in Translation studies at KULeuven in 2015 on the transfer activities of Francophone Flemish writer Georges Eekhoud (1854-1927) at the turn of the 20th century, with a special focus on the mediating role that Eekhoud played anonymously in the production of popular and patriotic literature. She has lectured on Belgian literature (UNamur), Translation theory and practice (Dutch into French) (ULiège), and Literary institutionalization (KULeuven).


   Her research interests include Translation history, Cultural mediators, Transfers and transmediality, Minority identities and regionalisms, Belgian literature, Complexity thinking, and Actor Network Theory. She is the author of numerous articles on these topics (see <https://researchportal.unamur.be/fr/persons/maud-gonne>), as well as of the monograph *Contrebande littéraire et culturelle à la Belle Époque: Le « hard labour » de Georges Eekhoud entre Anvers, Paris et Bruxelles* (Leuven University Press 2017). She also co-edited a special issue of *Revue Belge de Philologie et d’Histoire* entitled *Cultural Mediators in Belgium, 1830-1945* (2014).


   She is an active member of *Namur Institute of Language, Text and Transmediality* (NaLTT) (<https://naltt.unamur.be/>)."
